# Data Processing Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a data processing application that reads data from an input file, processes the data, removes excess space and comments from the code, tokenizes the remaining code, and prints the output in a tabular form.

## Features
- Reads data from an input file.
- Processes the data to remove excess space and comments from the code.
- Tokenizes the remaining code.
- Prints the code after removing excess space and comments.
- Tokenizes the remaining code and prints output in tabular form.

## To-Dos
1. Write code in the language of your choice to read data from an input file.
2. Process the data to remove excess space and comments from the code.
3. Tokenize the remaining code.
4. Print the code after removing excess space and comments.
5. Tokenize the remaining code and print output in tabular form.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have an input file named "input.txt" in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. The processed code and tokenized output will be displayed in the console.

## Example
Suppose the input file contains the following code:
